## 🔐 SECURITY (All Free)

### Remove Fake Admin Panel

The current admin panel (`/admin` route in code) is not secure. We should remove it since Netlify CMS provides a real admin panel.

**I can remove it for you** - it's just a UI mockup.

### Secure WhatsApp Number

Current code has hardcoded phone number. **Move to CMS settings** so you can change it anytime.
