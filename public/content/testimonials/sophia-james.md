name: Sophia & James
location: Notting Hill, London
text: We trusted them with our entire wedding party's garments - 8 bridesmaid dresses, 6 groomsmen suits, and our own outfits. Every single piece came back immaculate. Their expertise with different fabrics (silk, chiffon, wool, satin) is truly impressive. Highly recommend for large wedding parties.
